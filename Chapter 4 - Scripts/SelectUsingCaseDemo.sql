-- Using the CASE statement 

-- The policy manager has observed that the data in member cover does not show a column for CoverType 
-- how can we create a list of member covers that shows the cover type abbreviation e.g. DTH,   for the under writing year 2014 ?


-- Searched Case Expression  (Within a SELECT statement, the searched CASE expression allows for values to be replaced in the result set based on comparison values)

select

	[total_death_cover] != 0

-- Simple Case Expression	(Within a SELECT statement, a simple CASE expression allows for only an equality check; no other comparisons are made) 
-- The product manager requests an abbreviated gender value in the members table
