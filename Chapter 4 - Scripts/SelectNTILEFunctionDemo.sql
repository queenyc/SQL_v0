use [Chapter 3 - Sales (Keyed) ] ;					--<<< Sales db for this excercise

-- The Senior data analyst requires a list of Customer sales by quartile across Country/Province for France			

-- Base query from the purpose created view
-- The view is a list of all sales totals across the globe

/*
	Quartiles tell us about the spread of a data by breaking the data set into quarters, just like the median breaks it in half (2 Groups).
		
	In SQL we can use the NTILE() ranking function

	The groups are numbered, starting at one. 
	For each row, NTILE returns the number of the group to which the row belongs i.e. the Quartile.
