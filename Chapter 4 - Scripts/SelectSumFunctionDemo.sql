select

	,[ClaimCauseCategory]
	,cl.claimtype
	,mem.gender
	,sum([claimpaidamount]) as TotalClaimPaid

	[dbo].[Member] mem on cl.MemberKey = mem.MemberKey
where
	cl.claimtype in ('TPD') and
	 year(claimpaiddate) = 2014
group by
	 year(claimpaiddate)
	,[ClaimCauseCategory]
	,cl.claimtype
	,mem.gender
order by
	TotalClaimPaid desc

-- 2: Using predicates in the join , same result better performance

select 
	 TOP(5) year(claimpaiddate) as [Year]
	,[ClaimCauseCategory]
	,cl.claimtype
	,mem.gender
	,sum([claimpaidamount]) as TotalClaimPaid

						  cl.claimtype in ('TPD') and 	 
						  year(cl.claimpaiddate) = 2014
group by
	 year(claimpaiddate)
	,[ClaimCauseCategory]
