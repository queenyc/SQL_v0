-- Using case to discretise data

/*
	
 Discretization is puting data into buckets or bands for analysis
 this is a common data analysis function

 Scenario, the sales manager has requested a customer list with each customer and their age band 

 Banding rules are ...

			Age 19 - 32 = Gen Y
			Age 33 - 48 = Gen X
			Age 49 - 67 = Baby boomer
			Age 68 +    = Mature
