-- Chapter 6 - SQL How to session # 2
-- Measuring customer aquisition 

-- In this SQL How to, we build up a query to analyse the acuisition of new customers &
-- to some extent we leverage some basics from Cohort analysis as we are interested
-- in when the customer first purchased a product from us, hence we place them in 
-- the appropriate cohort for comparisons

-- Summary of Customer counts and sale values

	select
		 Year([OrderDate]) as SaleYear
		,count(distinct(customerkey)) as Customers
		,sum([SalesAmount]) as TotalSales
	from
		[dbo].[OnlineSales]
	group by
		 Year([OrderDate])
	order by
		 Year([OrderDate])

-- Step 1 , now get all the customers in a cohort, but we only require distinct customers, in other words
--          we dont want to count all customer occurrences for the cohort as this will skew the analysis
--		


	SELECT 
			distinct(os.CustomerKey)
		   ,cohorts.CohortMonthly
	FROM   
		   [dbo].[OnlineSales] os
		   JOIN (SELECT CustomerKey
					   ,Min([OrderDate]) AS FirstPurchDate 
					   ,cast(Year(Min([OrderDate])) as char(4)) + '-' + cast(month(Min([OrderDate])) as varchar(2)) as CohortMonthly
				 FROM   [OnlineSales] 		 
			     GROUP BY CustomerKey) AS cohorts 
		 ON os.CustomerKey = cohorts.CustomerKey 
	order by
		2

-- Step 2 , As we will use the LAG function shortly which requires a sort order, the cohort monthly will not work for this as it is an string
--			so we have to create numeric sort keys , we can use Year and Month, so in effect we are representing the cohort as a multi part 
--			numeric and whilst at it, reduce the rowset to just return counts for the cohort


	SELECT 
	     cohorts.CohortMonthly
		,YearSortKey
		,MonthSortKey
		,count(distinct(os.CustomerKey)) as CohortCustomerCount
	FROM   
 	    [dbo].[OnlineSales] os
		 JOIN (SELECT 
						CustomerKey
		  				,Min([OrderDate]) AS FirstPurchDate 
						,cast(Year(Min([OrderDate])) as char(4)) + '-' + cast(month(Min([OrderDate])) as varchar(2)) as CohortMonthly

	group by
	   cohorts.CohortMonthly	
	  ,YearSortKey
	  ,MonthSortKey
	order by
	2,3



-- Step 3 , now we can calculate the customer counts for current and previous cohorts and show the change, we use LAG for this
--		    plotting change on a chart reveals the trends
--
--			Note: These are only statistical (i.e counted) values, there is no deep analysis to determine numbers
--			      of customers are that returning across the cohorts
--				  Hence this analysis does assume customers are new customers only

	    ,count(distinct(cohorts.CustomerKey)) - LAG(count(distinct(cohorts.CustomerKey)), 1,0) OVER (ORDER BY YearSortKey,MonthSortKey) as ChangeToPrevCohort

-- Step 4 , Now extend the code to wrap within and outer query to enable neater calculation of the
--			% change over the cohorts, rather than use lag multiple times which is messy, Im for neat readable code
